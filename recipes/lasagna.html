These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated homemade lasagna recipe:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>

            <li>
            Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
            </li>
            <li>· Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
            </li>
            <li>· Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>· Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
            </li>
            <li>· Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
            </li>
            <li>· Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>· Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
            </li>
            <li>
                · Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.

            </li>
            <li>
                · Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).

            </li>
        </ul>
